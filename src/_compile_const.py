"""
This script (heuristically) extracts the actually used Windows API constants
from the rather big constants scripts const.py, and saves them as "compiled"
version const_c.py, which is then used in the frozen app to save a few KB.
The script could definitely be optimized a lot, but it's not runtime code
and just needs about a second to run, so who cares.
